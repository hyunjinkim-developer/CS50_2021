    -get input using get_string()

-count # of letters/ words/ sentences/
    -letters:
        -A ~ Z && a ~ z
        -NO punctuations/ digits/ any other symbols
    -words:
        -sequence of characters separated by spaces
        -hypenated word should be counted as 1 word
    -sentences:
        -end with .(period)/ !(exclation point)/ ?(question mark)
        -count as 1 sentence if period is using in the middle of sentence i.e. Mr./ Mrs/ 
-compute Coleman-Liau index
    -compute index using formula
        -be careful with truncation when divide integer with intger -> cast with (float) in one of the integer
        -L = (# of letters) / (# of words) * 100
        -S = (# of sentences) / (# of words) * 100
        -index = 0.0588 * L - 0.296 * S - 15.8
 -calculate and print grade
    -convert index to grade 
        -round to the nearest integer
            -using math.h round()
    -print "Grade #" (# is Coleman-Liau index)
        -if(index >= 16) print "Grade 16+"
        -if(index < 1) print "Before Grade 1"
