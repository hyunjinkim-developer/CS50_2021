prompt user for an amount of change
use get_float
accept only non-negative inputs
if not re-prompt
if(input is dollar)
multiply dollars by 100
be sure to round cents to nearest penny.

computing coins
use the largest coins possible
keep track of remaing change owed
keeping track of how many coins used
print the number of coins





input]
ask the user how much change is owed
-using get_float,:
-without dollar sign
(ex) $9 -> input will be 9 or 9.00)
-not too large for float
-non-negative value
if not) re prompt the user

greedy algorithm)
-if denominator and numverator are both integer -> one of them should be casted into float


rint the minimum number of coins with which that change can be made
(using printf, integer followed by \n)
